    "\n",
    "1. different deliminators\n",
    "The CSV files in our data lake used different delimiters. We fixed this by writing a delimiter discovery function. This function analyzes both the number of non-alphanumeric characters in each row of the table and the variance of these counts across rows. The character with the highest ratio of frequency to variance (+ a small constant 𝜖) emerges as the most likely delimiter. This approach successfully fixed this issue.\n",

    "When rows contain only zeros, any comparison function treats them as identical, even though they likely represent different data. Therefore, these rows are ignored.\n",

    "\n",
    "4. Large size of data\n",
    "Another problem we encountered was the large size of out datasets, especially table 14 was large. To still be able to do data discovery we used the computationally efficient Lazo as well as Silkmoth.\n"
