    "A very important aspect of supervised and semi-supervised machine learning is the quality of the labels produced by human labelers. Unfortunately, humans are not perfect and in some cases may even maliciously label things incorrectly. In this assignment, you will evaluate the impact of incorrect labels on a number of different classifiers.\n",
